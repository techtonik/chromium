## What Needs Work

Look at the Chromium bug tracker for open Linux issues:
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=os%3Alinux

Issues marked "Available" are ready for someone to claim. To claim an issue, add a comment and then a project member will mark it "Assigned". If none of the "Available" issues seem appropriate, you may be able to help an already claimed ("Assigned" or "Started") issue, but you'll probably want to coordinate with the claimants, to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.

Issues marked with HelpWanted are a good place to start.

### Random TODOs

We've also marked bits that remain to be done for porting with `TODO(port)` in the code.  If you grep for that you'll likely find plenty of small tasks to get started on.

### New Bugs

If you think you have discovered a new Linux bug, start by [searching for similar issues](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=Linux). When you search, make sure you choose the "All Issues" option, since your bug might have already been fixed, but the default search only looks for open issues. If you can't find a related bug, please create a [New Issue](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry). Use the linux defect template.
