// This files defines the interfaces and structures used for frames.
//
// When a client in the frame tree is connected to by way of the ViewManager a
// FrameClient is obtained (from the ServiceProvider interface request passed
// in ViewManager::OnEmbed()). The FrameClient is told the frame tree (by way
// of OnConnection()), which allows the client to use other frames in the tree
// (assuming the client has the appropriate permissions).
//
// frame_ids are the same as views ids. This means that when a client creates
// a new view to be part of the frame tree it immediately knows the id to use
// for Frame calls.
//
// The server provides an id that may be used to identify the state of the
// tree. The change id is an integer that is incremented every time the
// structure of the tree changes. The change id is not used by the server; the
// server only updates the change id and notifies clients of the new id (by
// way of structure change functions such as OnFrameAdded()).

// Expresses a preference for where a navigation should occur.
